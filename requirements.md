# Software Requirements

## Vision

This application will allow user's to take themselves out of reality and immerse themselves in a friendly, pixilated gaming environment. It will provide a fun experience for users who find themselves needing a quick break from their daily work. This product will also appeal to younger children with visually appealing graphics and simple controls.

## Scope

The game will:

- Feature a Gollum sprite that moves from point A to point B.
- Have a navigation bar that links to separate pages: creators page, a merch page (stretch goal), and a help/rules window.
- Include the rules and required key commands in the help window.
- Ask for a username so it can be stored along with a log of the user’s score and the top 3 high scores.
- Score the user based on the amount of time used to complete the game.

The game will not:

- Include multiple levels.
- Include bonus points.

## Minimum Viable Product

We are creating a website with a simple quick game made in canvas. The website will have a navigation bar directing the user to different parts of the site: Home, Game, About the creators, About the game. It will also contain a logo of the game and a center button taking the user straight to the game.
Before starting the game, the user will submit their name to store the results in. The goal of the game is for Gollum to get the Ring of Power. The user will move through the landscape using the keyboard arrows. After getting to the ring (or being captured by Orcs if we complete a stretch goal), the result will be displayed on the screen. If the user fails, they will see a Game Over pop-up. Help/rules tab will be available to access, and we’ll also create a button at the bottom of the screen to have the Help/rules pop up and hide when needed.

## Stretch Goals

- Display persistent scores on a separate page without forcing users to finish the game first.
- Create a separate page with “merchandise” (t-shirts with our pixelated faces or character sprites/logos).
- Create collision logic with obstacles (i.e.: orcs that might capture Gollum).
- Create a rudimentary health bar or meter to limit the number of collisions before “game over”.
- Institute countdown timer (starting at 60 seconds) to limit the amount of time users have to complete the game before “game over”.
