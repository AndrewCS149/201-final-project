        <h3>Marta Anthony</h3>
        <h4>Software Developer</h4>
        <p>My background is multi-faceted, I have a degree in French literature, and experience in human resources and recruiting. Programming is an extension of my passion for learning human languages. I speak fluently Polish, English and French, and I know the basics of German, Italian and Spanish. Creating things out of nothing makes me feel focused and energized, and I am excited to start a new career in software development.

        <h3>Andrew Smith</h3>
        <h4>Software Developer</h4>
        <p>Before becoming a software developer, I served in the Air Force for six years. I met my wife almost a year before I separated. She happened to be my flight attendant on a work trip I was on. I spent the last year (and even a few months after) of the military contemplating what to do upon my military separation date. I became focused on becoming a firefighter somewhere on the East Coast. Fortunately that did not work out. My wife (fiance at the time) pitched the idea of moving from the East Coast to Seattle. That idea became a reality very quickly. After a 45 hour car ride, we found ourselves in the beautiful, pacific northwest. My wife threw around the thought of turning technology into a career. I was hooked after writing my first line of code. I attended Code Fellows Code 102 course in August of 2019. I decided not continue with Code Fellows but to pursue the traditional college route. After two quarters at community college, I quickly realized I made a mistake. I retook code 102 in April of 2020, only this time my wife was accompanying (and surpassing me).</p>

        <h3>Diane Stephani</h3>
        <h4>Software Developer</h4>
        <p>I became a software developer after almost a decade of working in the service industry. As an amateur linguist, I enjoy the challenge of learning both spoken and programming languages. I am an alumn of Indiana University South Bend, and Univerzita Palackeho v Olomouci, Czech Republic.</p>

        <h3>Alex Whan</h3>
        <h4>Software Developer</h4>
        <p>I’m a software developer taking my first steps into the world of coding with Code Fellows after spending the last several years in the travel industry. My passion is connecting people from around the world and fostering cross-cultural communication through technology. I grew up playing classic video games, and have always loved how they’re a universal language that brings people together, no matter their origins. Always curious about the world, and driven to constantly learn more.</p>
